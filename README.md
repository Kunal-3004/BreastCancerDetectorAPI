# ðŸ§¬ Breast Cancer Detector API

This project provides a **Flask-based REST API** to detect breast cancer using machine learning.  
The trained model (`breast_cancer_detector.pkl`) can classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on medical features.

## ðŸ“Š How the Model Was Built

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Collected the Breast Cancer dataset (from `sklearn.datasets` or CSV).
   - Cleaned and handled missing values.

2. **Feature Scaling**
   - Applied **standardization (scaling)** to ensure all features contribute equally.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Plotted the **correlation matrix** to analyze relationships between features.
   - Selected the most relevant features.

4. **Model Training**
   - Trained multiple machine learning models:
     - Decision Tree  
     - Random Forest  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
     - Logistic Regression  

   - After comparison, **Logistic Regression** gave the **best performance**.

5. **Model Serialization**
   - Saved the trained Logistic Regression model as `breast_cancer_detector.pkl` using **pickle**.
